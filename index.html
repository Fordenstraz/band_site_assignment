				<h3>The Bees Knees</h3>

				<p>
					The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San
					Francisco, California. The band consists a dynamic lineup
					featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
					keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved its first
					commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention
					from their future manager. Having extensive experience
					working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
					confident the band could succeed even further with more
					support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known
					record label.
				</p>

				<p>
					From there, the band has soared, gaining international
					recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts.
					New fans immediately fell in love with the band's original
					and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
					hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans
					affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are
					drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage.
					The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio
					album, looking to be released in early 2024.
